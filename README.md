# lean4 tutorials

This is a collection of worked out exercises and examples in lean4 that I've
compiled in 2023 while teaching myself `lean4` and `mathlib4`.

This is all much harder (and more significant) than one would think because, as of
April 2023, `mathlib4` is still not fully ready for wide use and Mathematics
in Lean hasn't been ported yet.  (I've been doing this against the better
judgment of the Zulip community)
